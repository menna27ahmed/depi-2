           Identity Management Challenges:
1. Discuss common challenges organizations face in implementing identity

integrating with existing systems.
2. Provide examples of identity-related security incidents (e.g., account
takeovers) and explain how they could have been prevented with
proper identity management.

and we had anthor task:
  Data Encryption Demonstration:

• Choose a tool or programming language to encrypt a sample data file (e.g., OpenSSL, GPG, or a
Python encryption library).
• Document the steps to encrypt and decrypt the file, including the commands or code used.
• Explain the significance of encryption in data security and how it protects data in transit and
at rest.
